# qr_overlay
I have completed the test version of the QR Code Scanner and Overlay Tool. Here’s what’s been achieved:

Real-Time QR Scanner: The system detects QR codes using a camera feed and sends the data to the server.

Movable Transparent Overlay: A resizable, transparent window that you can position anywhere on the screen for easy scanning.

Server Integration: The scanned QR code data is successfully sent to the server via POST requests.
